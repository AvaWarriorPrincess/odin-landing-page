        <div class="quote-box">
          <p class="quote">In my time working with Ava, I have found her to be extremely competent and efficient. There have been several tasks that Ava has been challenged by which she has faced with a no-nonsense work ethic that propels her to get the job done. However, I believe it is her efficiency that has really served True Value well. Ava absorbs other's priorities. What I mean is that even though she has 100 tasks to complete, she knows that the task she is presented with is the most important to that individual and takes care of it in an efficient manner. It is this skill that has made her a joy to work with. In addition to all that, Ava is eager to learn and although she's become quite privy to our business in the time she has been here, she is always seeking to grow and understand even more. She keeps busy and is always willing to pitch in.</p>
